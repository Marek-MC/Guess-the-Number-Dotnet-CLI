### Guess the Number, a Dotnet CLI game to be played inside the terminal. 

Requires the Dotnet framework to execute.

As soon as you execute this program inside your CLI, you are prompted to choose a number between 1 and 1,000. 
Choose wrong, and the computer will tell you if you are too high or too low, and you get to guess again.
That's it! Guess until you win, and then the program will turn off. 

This program uses only the core library of the C# library.
